## Synopsis

Shut down PC when .exe closes

## What this is

Simple Windows .bat script to shut off the computer when an .exe closes. Useful when you are running an app in a public place and you want the computer to just do one thing.  

## How to use

Put whatever app you want to run in the startup folder. (...AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup)
Change AlienAfterlife.exe to whatever file it is that is running. Save your .bat file.
Save the .bat file anywhere and put a shortcut to it in the Windows 10 startup folder where you have the .exe.
Now your computer will only run that exe and shut off when you quit it. 
If you want to change things just alt+tab out of the .exe, close the .bat file and remove the .exe and .bat from the startup folder.
